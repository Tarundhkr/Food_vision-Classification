# Food_vision-Classification
This project focuses on classifying images of sushi, steak, and pizza using a custom implementation of the ResNet-9 architecture trained on a subset of the FoodVision-101 dataset. The dataset consists of 200 images each for testing and 800 images each for training, meticulously curated to ensure diverse representations of the three food classes.
